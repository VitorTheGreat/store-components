# Availability Subscriber


`AvailabilitySubscriber` is a VTEX Component that shows the availability subscriber form that is shown when the product isn't available. This Component can be imported and used by any VTEX App.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
>
> This component only **creates a list** of the users that subscribe to this product. Currently it **doesn't send an automatic email** to these users when the product becomes available. It only collects the emails of the users that show interest on the products.

> üì¢ **Disclaimer:** Do not fork this project, use, contribute, or open issue with your feature request.

## Usage

You should follow the usage instruction in the main [README](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-components#usage).

Then, add `availability-subscriber` block into your app theme, as we do in our [Product Details app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-details/blob/master/store/blocks.json). 

To collect the emails correctly, this feature needs a special configuration on **Master Data**. Otherwise, the subscriber form won't be properly saved with user emails. For more info, access the recipe on [Creating a product availability form](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-product-availability-form).                  


### Blocks API

When implementing this component as a block, various inner blocks may be available. The following interface lists the available blocks within `AvailabilitySubscriber` and describes if they are required or optional.

```json
  "availability-subscriber": {
    "component": "AvailabilitySubscriber"
  }
```

For now this block does not have any required or optional blocks.

### Configuration

>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
>
> Before configuring the Availability Subscriber block in your theme, make sure you've already configured a **JSON schema in Master Data**, otherwise the subscriber form won't be properly saved with user emails. To more info, access the recipe on [Creating a product availability form](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-product-availability-form).

1. Import the  `vtex.store-component` app to your theme's dependencies in the  `manifest.json`;

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.store-components": "3.x"
  }
```

2. Add the `availability-subscriber` block to your theme‚Äôs product template (`store.product`). For example:

```
"store.product": {
    "children": [
      "availability-subscriber‚Äù
    ]
}

```

Once the block is added, the component will be rendered without the need for further configurations, since the `availability-subscriber` block does not have any props. 

Note the following: the `availability-subscriber` block simply renders a form component highlighting user interest in a particular product. For the collected emails to actually be stored in the store's Master Data, you‚Äôll need to implement some advanced settings in the  Master Data module.


### Styles API
